# Simple Linear Regression on Tips
This repository contains a project that explores the basics of regression analysis by modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable. The project uses a dataset containing information about tips given by customers at a restaurant. The goal is to predict the total bill based on the tip amount. The project includes steps for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model building using scikit-learn, and model evaluation. It also explores advanced concepts such as handling outliers, feature scaling, and residual analysis. This project is a great resource for anyone looking to understand the implementation of simple linear regression and its applications in real-world datasets.
